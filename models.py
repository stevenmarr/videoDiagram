"""
Model module for the Video Flow Line Diagram Editor.

This file will define data models (e.g., using SQLAlchemy for DB persistence of diagrams).
Currently a placeholder, as the app is client-side driven. In agile sprints, add classes for
Diagram, Node, etc., and integrate with a DB.

For testing: Add unit tests for model validation (e.g., test_node_creation).
"""

# Placeholder for future models
# Example (uncomment when adding DB):
# from flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy
# db = SQLAlchemy()

# class Node(db.Model):
#     id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)
#     name = db.Column(db.String(100))
#     # Add fields as needed
